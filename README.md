## Procedural Music Generation

This project is a little research piece to delve deeper into algorithims involving procedural music generation, combining both the arts and music theory to make musically pleasing outputs with both good melody and rythym.

I am trying to do this WITHOUT implementing Neural Networks or Machine Learning of any sort, by using a range of techniques such as Markov Chains (already done), Genetic Algorithims and whatever else I find on the interwebs :D
